					<h4>We Ask Questions to Frame & Collect</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> As Einstein noted, spending time on the questions makes the work easier of getting the data we need.
					</p>		
					<p class="text-small"> We formulate questions to frame our data exercises. These framing questions can be thought of as our research question. They help define the data we need and guide our entire process. Data-driven insight starts with good framing questions.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">We also ask questions to collect data. These types of questions help us acquire the data we need to answer our framing question. How we ask these questions shape the answers we get and the resulting data. High quality data starts with good data collection questions.

					</p>

                    </div>
                    <h4>Ask, Answer, Act</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Clear questions both start and bind our data exercises. They are key to ensuring we acquire the data we need, unlock value and insight in that data, and use that insight to drive action. In short, ask, answer, act.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Every data exercise, whether a multi-sector needs assessment, assessing the effectiveness of community engagement activities, or creation  of a COVID-19 dashboard is driven by a well-defined question, should start with a question we are trying to answer.

                    <p class="text-small"> A framing question is fundamental in any data exercise yet it remains am under-appreciated and overlooked part of the process. Why do framing questions matter?
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ul>
							<li class="text-small"> They give our data exercises direction and focus.</li>
							<li class="text-small"> They inform our actions and outputs at every step of the exercise. </li>
							<li class="text-small">They keep data processes aligned to a common reference point, making sure we collect only the data we need and produce the type of analysis required to make decisions.</li>

                    <h4>Good Questions Anchor & Clarify</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Good questions anchor your data exercise and guide you in finding the answers you need to make data informed decisions. To do this well, questions should be:
							<ul class="text-small">
								<li> <b>Specific</b> enough to tell us what needs to be analysed, where, when and on what scale;  </li>
								<li> <b>Relevant</b> to an objective and focused on what needs to be understood in order to make a decision;</li>
								<li><b>Comprehensive</b> of everything that needs to be understood in order to make that decision. We do not want to be left still seeking answers; and</li>
								<li><b>Realistic,</b> that, given data availability and resource constraints, what we want to know is possible to know? </li>
							</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Getting to the right question can take time, but is time well spent.

                    <h4> The Role of Questions in Data Analysis</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> The question we ask shapes the analysis we do. Our question will be shaped by the audience of the analysis, how the results are intended to be used, as well as the data, time and resources available to answer the question we've asked. There are different types, or stages, of analysis, each of which helps us answers different types of questions. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> 
						<ul class="text-small">
							<li>Descriptive analysis asks what happened in the past.</b>  </li>
							<li>Explanatory analysis asks why something happened in the past.</b></li>
							<li>Interpretive analysis ask what is most salient or important.</b></li>
							<li>Predictive analysis asks what is most likely to happen in the future.</b></li>
							<li>Prescriptive analysis ask what we should do about it.</li>

                    <p class="text-small">These different stages of analysis build on each other but this does not mean we should be aiming to do more andvanced forms of analysis in every siutation. More advanced forms of analysis are more labour intensive. In some cases, simply knowing what happened is sufficient.

                    </div>
					<h4> What Happened?</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> At times, when we look to data for an answer, we simply want to know what happened. These 'who, what, where, when & how many' type questions are descriptive. Descriptive questions ask us to compare and contrast data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies or outliers. They help us explore and understand what has happened in the past. </p>
					<p class="text-small"> 
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>How many cases of COVID-19 have been reported? </li>
							<li>Are the numbers of cases increasing or decreasing? </li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Many of the COVID-19 dashboards have been designed to answer exactly these types of questions.</p>

                        <div class="header_title">02</div>
                    </div>
                    <h4> Why Did it Happen?</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> When knowing what happened is important but insufficient to support decision making, we may need more from our data than a simple summary. Explanatory questions lead the analyst to investigate causal relationships, identify underlying factors, and seek a deeper understanding of why something is happening.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">We ask explanatory questions when we want to uncover associations, correlations, connections and relationships between various data points.  
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="intrepretive_questions">
					<div class="header_bar centrered">
                        <div class="header_title">02</div>
                    </div>
                    <h4> What is the Most Important?</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Knowing how much, how many or what happened can serve as a foundation for when we need to know what is most important. Interpretive questions ask us to prioritise, rate or rank. We use these type of questions when we want to know what is essential and why. In short, they ask to interpret from an array of data what, where or who, we need to focus on.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">A typical example of this type of question would be:
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li >In which countries is the COVID-19 pandemic the most severe? </li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">This example question is asking to consider a number of factors that have been described, to judge or determine what countries are a priority or the most important. </p>

                        <div class="header_title">02</div>
                    </div>
                    <h4> What is Most Likely to Happen Next? </h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Predictive questions ask to extend current conditions to forecast future outcomes, to develop alternative futures or to identify triggers. These questions seek to anticipate what could happen next. 
					</p> 
					<p class="text-small"> Within the COVID-19 context, this could mean developing predictive models to help better understand the expected scale or duration of the crisis  (i.e. the total number of cases, severe cases and deaths) in specific locations. It could also mean developing models to assess how different response interventions can be expected to impact the epidemic curve.

                    <h4>Getting Specific</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> We often start a data exercise with a concept that we want to explore. It can be hard to know precisely what data we need to analyse this concept. To better understand what data we need, the first step is to define different dimensions of the concept. From there, it is necessary to identify the different indicators we could use to assess those dimensions. Once  the indiactors have been identified, it becomes easier to hone in on the specific data required to answer the question.

                    <h4>Going from Abstract to Concrete</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> The difference between dimensions, indicators and measures is not always clear. Depending on the complexity of the question, there may be no distinction. What is important in this process is to ensure that abstract concepts are clearly broken down into concrete data points that can be measured. This is often done using an analytical framework. Take, for exmaple, the following analytical framework for the Inform Risk Index.

					<p class="text-small"> <b>“What are community perceptions about transmission of COVID-19?”</b></p>
					<p class="text-small">In order to answer this question we are going to need to better understand the following dimensions of the problem space:
						<ul class="text-small">
							<li>Concerns and perceptions of risk surrounding coronavirus; </li>
							<li>Types of preventative measures practiced;  </li>
							<li>Level of trust in governments and the commercial sector; and</li>
							<li>Information sources on coronavirus and changes in media consumption.

								<li >Make sure your questions include everything you need to know to act.</li>
								<li>Don’t be afraid to get specific. The more you know about the dimensions of the topic you are investigating, the more focused your data exercise will be. </li>
								<li>Be realistic in what you ask. We need to ensure that we keep our questions grounded in what is possible and must be known.</li>
								<li>Understand the answer your question will render and ask yourself if this is sufficient to act.</li>
