					<h4>We Ask Questions to Frame & Collect</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> As Einstein noted, spending time on the questions makes the work easier of getting the data we need.
					</p>		
					<p class="text-small"> We formulate questions to frame our data exercises. These framing questions can be thought of as our research question. They help define the data we need and guide our entire process. Data-driven insight starts with good framing questions.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">We also ask questions to collect data. These types of questions help us acquire the data we need to answer our framing question. How we ask these questions shape the answers we get and the resulting data. High quality data starts with good data collection questions.

                    <h4>Ask, Answer, Act</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Clear questions both start and bind our data exercises. They are key to ensuring we acquire the data we need, unlock value and insight in that data, and use that insight to drive action. In short, ask, answer, act.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Every data exercise, whether a multi-sector needs assessment, assessing the effectiveness of community engagement activities, or creation  of a COVID-19 dashboard is driven by a well-defined question, should start with a question we are trying to answer.

                    <p class="text-small"> A framing question is fundamental in any data exercise yet it remains am under-appreciated and overlooked part of the process. Why do framing questions matter?
					</p>

                    <h4>Good Questions Anchor & Clarify</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Good questions anchor your data exercise and guide you in finding the answers you need to make data informed decisions. To do this well, questions should be:
							<ul class="text-small">
								<li> <b>Specific</b> enough to tell us what needs to be analysed, where, when and on what scale;  </li>
								<li> <b>Relevant</b> to an objective and focused on what needs to be understood in order to make a decision;</li>
								<li><b>Comprehensive</b> of everything that needs to be understood in order to make that decision. We do not want to be left still seeking answers; and</li>
								<li><b>Realistic,</b> that, given data availability and resource constraints, what we want to know is possible to know? </li>
							</ul>
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Getting to the right question can take time, but is time well spent.

                    <h4> From Broad to Specific</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> 	
					We often start a data exercise with a broad concept or problem space we want to explore. It can be hard to know what data need to analyse that problem space. The first step is to define the different dimensions of the concept that we want to explore. This will help us to determine the different indicators we can use to assess the dimensions. And finally, we will be able to more easily hone in on the specific data needed to measure those indicators.

                    <p class="text-small"> The question we ask shapes the analysis we do. The question you ask depends on many factors including the audience of the analysis, how the results of the analysis will be used, and the data, time and resources available to answer the question we've asked. There are different types, or stages, of analysis, each of which helps us answers different types of questions.

					<p class="text-small"> 
						<ul class="text-small">
							<li>Descriptive analysis asks what happened in the past.</b>  </li>
							<li>Explanatory analysis asks why something happened in the past.</b></li>

                    <p class="text-small">These different types of analysis build on each other with the the more advanced forms of analysis often being more labour intensive and collaborative. This does not mean that in every case we should be aiming to do more andvanced forms of analysis. Sometimes knowing what happened is sufficient. The analysis we do should always follow from what we want to know. In other words, it should follow from the question we ask.

					<h4> What Happened?</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> At times, when we look to data for an answer, we simply want to know what happened. These 'who, what, where, when & how many' type questions are descriptive. Descriptive questions ask us to compare and contrast data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies or outliers. They help us explore and understand what has happened in the past. </p>
					<p class="text-small"> 
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>How many cases of COVID-19 have been reported? </li>
							<li>Are the numbers of cases increasing or decreasing? </li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Many of the COVID-19 dashboards have been designed to answer exactly these types of questions.</p>

					<h4> Descriptive Analysis</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> Descriptive analysis help users understand a topic and its various facets but does not attempt to provide an explanation or interpretation. For example, this interactive dashboard summerises and compares measures that governments have taken to slow the spread of COVID-19.

                    <h4> Why Did it Happen?</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> When knowing what happened is important but insufficient to support decision making, we may need more from our data than a summary. Explanatory questions lead the analyst to investigate causal relationships, identify underlying factors, and seek a deeper understanding of why something is happening.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">We ask explanatory questions when we want to uncover associations, correlations, connections and relationships between various data points.

                    <h4> What is the Most Important?</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Knowing how much, how many or what happened can serve as a foundation for when we need to know what is most important. Interpretive questions ask us to prioritise, rate or rank. We use these type of questions when we want to know what is essential and why. In short, they ask to interpret from an array of data what, where or who, we need to focus on.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">A typical example of this type of question would be:
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li >In which countries is the situation the most severe? </li>
							<li ></li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">This example question is asking to consider a number of factors that have been described, to judge or determine what countries are a priority or the most important. </p>

                    <h4> What is Most Likely to Happen Next? </h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Predictive questions ask to extend current conditions to forecast future outcomes, to develop alternative futures or to identify triggers. These questions seek to anticipate what could happen next. 
					</p> 
					<p class="text-small"> Within the COVID-19 context, this could mean developing predictive models to help better understand the expected scale or duration of the crisis  (i.e. the total number of cases, severe cases and deaths) in specific locations. It could also mean developing models to assess how different response interventions can be expected to impact the epidemic curve.

                    <p class="text-small"> Let's take the question: What are community perceptions about transmission of COVID-19? This is a descriptive question as we are seeking to summarise community perceptions. Our next step is to tease out the dimensions, indicators and measures that can be used to answer this question.

                    <h4>Going from Abstract to Concrete</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> The differences between dimensions, indicators and measures is not always clear. Depending on the complexity of the question, there may be no distinction. What is important in this process is to ensure that abstract concepts are clearly translated into concrete data points that can be measured. This is often done using an analytical framework: The Inform Risk Index uses the following dimensions to answer the question <b>'In which countries is the situation the most severe?'</b>

We can collect this data by asking a similar question in a number of different ways. Each question will result in slight different data.

					<h4>Question Types</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Broadly speaking, during a data collection exercise, there are two types of questions that you can: open-ended and closed-ended questions. By understanding the difference between the two, you can learn to ask better questions and get better, more actionable data. This is evidenced in the expample below.

				<section id="open_ended">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">16</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Understanding Open-Ended Questions</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Open-ended questions give your respondents the opportunity to answer in their own words, instead of limiting their response to a set of pre-determined answers. Examples include: 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li> How do you think COVID-19 is transmitted?</li>
							<li> How do you think the situation with COVID-19 will evolve in the next three months?
							</li>
						</ol> 							
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">Note: It is often common to include an open-ended response option of “Other, Specify” in closed-ended questions. 
					</p>

					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">17</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Using Open-Ended Question Data</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Opened-ended questions result in unstructured data. This type of data can be rich with information impossible to gather through closed-ended questions. Open-ended questions help you learn about respondent needs you did not  know existed and can help focus attention on topics you had not considered. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">The drawbacks of opened-ended questions is that unstructured data often takes longer to analyse and has limitations in terms of the analytics that can be performed. 
					</p>

				<section id="closed_ended">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">18</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Understanding Closed-Ended Questions </h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Close-ended questions produce structured data. This makes it easier to collect, clean and perform quantitative analysis. Below are a few types of closed-ended questions.  
					</p>
					<img src="pics/closed_types.png" alt="response types" height= "350" class="no_shadow"/>
				</section>
				<section id="response_options">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">20</div>
					</div>
					<h4> Structured Response Options</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Close-ended questions have an expected pointed response. The data you get back (e.g. level of precision on answers, standardization, etc.) will depend on the response options available and permitted, and the prompts or guidance provided.   
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>Multiple Choice Single-Select & Multi-Select;  </li>
							<li>Ranking</li>
							<li>Rating Scales</li>

					<h4>Multiple Choice Single-Select & Multi-Select</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">One of the differences between types of multiple choice questions is whether to let respondents choose multiple response options or just one.

					</div>
					<h4>Data Types</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Depending on how you ask a question, you will produce different types of data. We will explore two broad categories of data. <b>Categorical data</b> is qualitative and can either be nominal or ordinal. <b>Numerical data</b> is quantitative and can either be interval or ratio.</li>
						</ol> 							
					</p>

				</section>
				<section id="nominal_scale">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">23</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Nominal Data Questions </h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Categorical nominal data is data that has two or more categories that do not have an intrinsic or logical order. Countries, gender and humanitarian sectors are all examples of this type of data. Categorical nominal data questions present respondents with predefined response options that are non-numeric in nature. 					
					</p>

				</section>
				<section id="nominal_scale">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">24</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Nominal Data Analysis </h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> With nominal data, we can calculate frequencies (how often each category occurs) and would use the mode as the measure of central tendency. The nominal data can be grouped together into categories, and for each category, the frequency or percentage can be calculated. The data can also be presented visually, such as by using a pie chart.

				<section id="ordinal_scale">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">25</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Ordinal Data Quesitons</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Ordinal data is categorical data in which the categories can be arranged in a meaningful order. To remember the difference, think ordered for ordinal and named for nominal. One important caveat is that on an ordinal scale, the order of response categories is significant  but you cannot quantify the exact difference between each category.

				<section id="ordinal_analysis">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">26</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Ordinal Data Analysis </h4>	
					<p class="text-small">If you have ordinal data you can calculate the frequencies and percentage for the different categories. For the measure of central tendency you can use both the mode and the median. Bar charts are great for visualising ordinal data.</p>

					<div class="header_bar centreblue">

					</div>
					<h4>Numerical Data</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Numerical data can either use an interval or ratio scale. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>Interval values can be ordered, and the distance between each number is meaningful but arbitrary. Think of interval scales as scales created by humans where there is no true zero. This type of data is not very common in the humanitarian sector, but examples include time, temperature and oedema.</li>
							<li>Ratio values can be ordered, and the distance between each number has meaning. Importantly, for ratio values the value of zero is meaningful (i.e. zero means a complete absence). Examples are age, household size, height and weight. This is the most versatile data in terms of statistical calculations that can be performed. </li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="ratio_scale">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">28</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Ratio Data Analysis</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Ratio data is what we commonly think of when we think about numerical data. The number of people in need, number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and age are all examples of ratio data. In data collection forms, collecting clean ratio data means using data validation and prompts to gather a specific-response.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Statistically, this data is the most versatile. 
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>You can calculate the mode, median and mean. </li>
							<li>You can add and subtract the values. </li>
							<li>You can multiply or divide the values.</li>
						</ol>
