                    <p class="text-small"> The ability to formulate good questions is a uniquely powerful tool for unlocking value in data.
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Every data exercise, whether you are starting a multi-sector needs assessment, conducting analysis for an HNO or assessing the effectiveness of a community meeting, requires you to first define the question(s) you are trying to answer.

					<h4>We Ask Questions to Frame and Collect</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Why do we ask questions? </p>		
					<p class="text-small"> We ask questions <b>to frame our data exercises</b>. This can be thought of as our research question. It helps define the data we need and guides our entire process. High-quality data and data-driven insight all start with a good question.  
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">We ask questions <b>to gather data</b>. These types of questions help us acquire the data we need to answer our framing question. How we ask a question shapes the answers and the resulting data. This includes the questions that we ask during primary data collection

                    <p class="text-small"> A framing question is a fundamental element in any data exercise. It is also an under-appreciated and overlooked part of the data management process. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ul>
							<li class="text-small"> Questions focus and frame all data exercises.</li>
							<li class="text-small"> At every step of the data management process, we use our question to inform our actions and outputs.</li>
							<li class="text-small"> Poorly defined questions can lead to misaligned data processes where we collect data we do not need and produce analysis that does not help us make decisions. </li>

                    <p class="text-small"> Understanding the type of analysis you need to do, will help in the formulation of your framing questions. Through your data exercise, are you trying to describe, explain, interpret, or anticipate a phenomenon, or are you trying to prescribe a response? These different stages of analysis beg different questions.

					<h4> Descriptive Questions</h4>
					<p class="text-small"> Descriptive questions will drive data exercises when we want to summarise or compare data. These types of framing question asks who, what, how many, when and where.  Descriptive questions result in analysis and products that help user engage with and understand different data points but do not attempt to highlight trends or provide an interpretation. They describe. Descriptive data questions could be: 
						<ol>
							<li class="text-small"> What measures have governments taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 in low and middle income countries?  </li>
							<li class="text-small"> How many cases of COVID-19 have been reported in locations with a Humanitarian Response Plan?</li>
							<li class="text-small">What are community perceptions about the COIVD-19 pandemic in location?</li>

                    <h4> Explanatory Questions</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Explantory questions seek to find associations, correlations, connections and relationships between data points. Questions like what follows what, what happened next, what else could explain what we are seeing are all examples of explanatory questions. Examples include:
						<ul>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>

                    <h4> Interpretive Questions</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Interpretive questions aim to move analysis beyond stating the findings towards drawing well-supported conclusions based on data. Severity indexes are a good example of this type of analysis as they seek to evaluate evidence and rate severity. Examples include:
						<ul>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>

                    <h4> Predicitive Questions </h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Anticipatory or predictive questions seek to look at the future and use past data to predicitive future outcomes. Examples include:
						<ul>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>
							<li class="text-small"> </li>

                    <h4> Revelevant, Comprehensive & Specific</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> As you can see, framing questions drive the type of analysis you need to perform and as a result are critical in getting you the information you need to act. However, for framing questions to help generate actionable insight, they should be: 
						<ul>
							<li class="text-small"> <b>Relevant</b> to your objective so you collect only what you need, to arrive at your answers. </li>
							<li class="text-small"> <b>Comprehensive</b> to everything you need to know, so you are not left still seeking answers. </li>
							<li class="text-small"> <b>Specific</b> enough to guide your data process, defining.</li>

                    <h4> Going from Board to Specific</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> A good framing question establishes what we want to know: the broad concepts and their specific dimensions. This helps further crystallize indicators for understanding the dimension and the specific data needed to measure those indicators.

                    <h4> Framing a COVID-19 Question</h4>
                    <p class="text-small"> Let’s consider a fictional framing question for a data exercise around COVID-19 that will be used to build information campaigns. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> <b>“What are community perceptions about transmission of COVID-19?”</b></p>
					<p class="text-small">This is a descriptive question where we seek to summarise community perceptions to better understand, for example:
						<ul class="text-small">
							<li> Concerns and perceptions of risk surrounding coronavirus; </li>
							<li> Types of preventative measures practiced;  </li>
							<li>Level of trust in governments and the commercial sector; and</li>
							<li>Information sources on coronavirus and changes in media consumption.

					<h4>Questions for Data Collection</h4>				
					<p class="text-small">The data we need to answer our framing questions does not always exist. We may have to collect the data ourselves. To do this, we need to break down the dimensions of our framing questions into specific data collection questions. In this section, we will focus on fine-tuning our data collection questions to ensure that we get the data we need.

                    </div>
					<h4>Data Collection Question Example</h4>				
					<p class="text-small">Consider our framing question “What are community perceptions about transmission of COVID-19?”, and the dimension of preventative measure. If we want to explore handwashing frequency, the data we need is the number of times people wash their hands per day. We can get this data by asking a question in a number of different ways all of which will provide different types of data.

					<h4>Collecting the Data We Need</h4>				
						<p class="text-small"> Different data collection questions yield different data. The Question Type, Question Anatomy (which includes Response Options) all influence the Type of Data you get and what you can do with that data.

					<div class="header_bar centreblue">

					<h4>Question Types</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Broadly speaking, during a data collection exercise, there are two types of questions that you can: open-ended and closed-ended questions. By understanding the difference between the two, you can learn to ask better questions and get better, more actionable data. This is evidenced in the expample below. 
					</p>
					<img src="pics/Open_Closed_Questions.png" alt="Question_Types" height="400" class="no_shadow"/>

			<section>
				<section id="open_ended">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">03</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Understanding Open-Ended Questions</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Open-ended questions give your respondents the opportunity to answer in their own words, instead of limiting their response to a set of pre-determined answers. Examples include: 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li> How do you think COVID-19 is transmitted?</li>
							<li> How do you think the situation with COVID-19 will evolve in the next three months?
							</li>
						</ol> 							
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">Note: It is often common to include an open-ended response option of “Other, Specify” in closed-ended questions. 
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="open_ended_analysis">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">03</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Using Open-Ended Question Data</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Opened-ended questions result in unstructured data. This type of data can be rich with information impossible to gather through closed-ended questions. Open-ended questions help you learn about respondent needs you did not  know existed and can help focus attention on topics you had not considered. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">The drawbacks of opened-ended questions is that unstructured data often takes longer to analyse and has limitations in terms of the analytics that can be performed. 
					</p>

			</section>
				<section id="closed_ended">
					<div class="header_bar centreblue">
						<div class="header_title">03</div>
					</div>
					<h4>Understanding Closed-Ended Questions </h4>	
					<p class="text-small">There are many different types of close ended questions but the one thing that they all have in common is that they produce structured data. This makes it easier to collect, clean and perform quantitative analysis. Below are a few examples of closed-ended questions using multiple choice, ranking and rating scales as pre-determined ressponse options.

                    </div>
					<h4>Anatomy of a question</h4>				
						<p class="text-small"> Data collection questions have three distinct components, all of which influence the data you will collect.  
						</p>
						<p class="text-small">
							<ol class="text-small">
								<li> The wording of the question influences the answer. To collect accurate data, make sure you use clear terminology, that your question is measuring what it intends to measure, and that the question is answerable and unbiased. </li>
								<li> The response options to the question will shape the data you collect and what you can do with the data. How the question can be answered ranges from structured to unstructured.  </li>
								<li> The prompts are directions provided to respondents on how to answer the question you asked. These instructions are useful in preventing respondent errors. 
								</li>

					<h4>Data Types</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Depending on how you ask a question, you will produce different types of data. We will explore two broad categories of data. <b>Categorical data</b> is qualitative and can either be nominal or ordinal. <b>Numeric data</b> is quantitative and can either be interval or ratio.</li>

					</div>
					<h4>Nominal Data Questions </h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Categorical nominal data is data that has two or more categories that do not have an intrinsic or logical order. Countries, gender and humanitarian sectors are all examples of categorical nominal data. Categorical nominal data questions often present respondents with predefined response options that are non-numeric in nature.

					<h4>Nominal Data Analysis </h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> If you have nominal data you can calculate the frequencies, how often each category occues and use the mode as the measure of central tendency. A pie chart could be used to display this data.

					<h4>Ordinal Data Quesitons</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Ordinal data is categorical data in which the categories can be arranged in a meaningful order. To remember, think ordered for ordinal. One important caveat is that on an ordinal scale, the order of response categories is significant, but you cannot quantify the exact difference between each category.

					<h4>Ordinal Data Analysis </h4>	
					<p class="text-small">If you have ordinal data you can calculate the frequencies and percentage for the different categories. For the measure of central tendency you can use both the mode and the median. Bar charts are great for visualising ordinal data.	</p>

					<p class="text-small">Numeric data can either use an interval or ratio scale. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>Interval values can be ordered, and the distance between each number is meaningful but arbitrary. Think of interval scales as scales created by humans. This type of data is not very common in the humanitarian sector, but examples include time, temperature and oedema.</li>
							<li>Ratio values can be ordered, and the distance between each number has meaning. Importantly, for ratio values the value of zero is meaningful (i.e. zero means a complete absence). Examples are age, household size, height and weight. This is the most versatile data in terms of calculations that can be performed. </li>

					<h4>Ratio Data Analysis</h4>	
					<p class="text-small"> Ratio data is what we commonly think of when we think about numberic data. The number of people in need, number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and age are all examples of ratio data. In data collection forms, collecting clean ratio data means using an closed-ended questions and prompting a specific-response. Data validation in collection forms is helpful here. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-small"> Statistically, this data is the most versatile. 
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li>You can calculate the mode, median and mean. </li>
							<li>You can add and subtract the values. </li>
							<li>You can multiply or divide the values.</li>

					<h4>Response Options</h4>	
					<p class="text-small">Close-ended questions have an expected pointed response. When formulating response options, consider:   
					</p>
					<p class="text-small">
						<ol class="text-small">
							<li> The level of precision needed. This will determine if you provide predefined response options, with options you determine or an “Other, Specify” field, to capture exact or approximate answers.  </li>
							<li>Providing valid responses to help standardise responses. If an answer can only be a yes or no, make those the predefined response options to avoid getting a maybe or somewhat. </li>
							 <li>Specifying formats to avoid misinterpretation. If date formats should be two digit UK format make that a prompt (dd/mm/yy).</li>
